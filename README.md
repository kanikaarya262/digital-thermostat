# DIGITAL THERMOSTAT
## Design and simulation of digital thermostat
To complete this task i used atmega32 microcontroller for simulation purpose proteus vsm was used,the following file will have description of designing steps for programming i used microchipstudio ide.
atmega 32 is 8 bit microcontroller part of AVR family equiped with 32 kb flash, risc architecture also with 32 i/o pins and many more features made a suitable choice for this application, attiny 424 or similar microcontrollers and similar microcontrollers can also be used along with lcd drivers. but for simplicity i used atmega 32.
