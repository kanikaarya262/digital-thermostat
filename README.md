# DIGITAL THERMOSTAT
## Design and simulation of digital thermostat(vyorius Embedded Test)
To complete this task i used atmega32 microcontroller for simulation purpose proteus vsm was used,the following file will have description of designing steps for programming i used microchipstudio ide.
atmega 32 is 8 bit microcontroller part of AVR family equiped with 32 kb flash, risc architecture also with 32 i/o pins and many more features made a suitable choice for this application, attiny 424 or similar microcontrollers and similar microcontrollers can also be used along with lcd drivers. but for simplicity i used atmega 32.
following were the requirements of the task:
-**programming language**:c/c++
-**Temperature Simulation**:build a function give random temperature values that can be used as different sensor values
-**User interaction**: interface allowing user to set temperature
-**Control logic**: controlling motor tu run dc motor for cooling purpose and switching on realy tu turn heater on. The duration ,speed and selection of device depends on desired temperature and current temperature
-**Feedback Display**: interface 16x2 lcd to display current and desired temperature.
the details of accomplishment of each requirement is described below:
